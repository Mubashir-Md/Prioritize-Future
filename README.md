Prioritizing tasks is a critical skill for effective time management. By prioritizing tasks, you can ensure that you are spending your time on the most important and 
urgent tasks, rather than getting bogged down in less important ones. One useful approach to prioritizing tasks is to use a system such as the Eisenhower Matrix, which 
categorizes tasks based on their urgency and importance. By focusing on tasks that are both urgent and important, you can ensure that you are making the most of your 
time and achieving your goals. Other helpful strategies include breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable ones, and scheduling your most important tasks 
for times when you are most alert and productive. Overall, prioritizing tasks is essential for effective time management, and can help you achieve your goals more 
efficiently and effectively.
